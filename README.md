# Striver-SDE-Sheet-Challenge2023
Striver’s SDE Sheet Challenge is back for the year 2023, and this time we are having prizes worth 2.25L. Most of you must be enjoying your summer vacations, but you can make the most out of it, by completing the Striver’s Sheet which has been used by 2M+ people in order to prepare for placements.
With placements nearby, everyone wants to prepare with full dedication. What if your preparation is a challenge with added incentives? Won’t that motivate you, it will isn’t it?
So we here at takeUforward have decided to come up with a 60-day Striver’s SDE sheet challenge. You will be having 60 days to complete the sheet which almost every college in this country is following.
